# Mearsk Innovation Challenge 
This is an innovation project put fourth by Mearsk. Mearsk is a shipping container company who contribute to transporting 80% of the worlds goods.
With shipping being the cheapest and most used method for transporting goods across the atlantic, it is unfortuantely also a target for ilegal smugling.
There are many things being smugled in containers, but one of the most impactful things is cocaine.

This project is an innovation project that aims to combat smugling, by increasing visibility and tightining the security around access to the contents of the container.

## How does it work?

Using a light sensor can detect how many photons enter the container, which can be used to detect if the doors or other openings have opened.
Together with a two-factor authentication system to engage and disengage
